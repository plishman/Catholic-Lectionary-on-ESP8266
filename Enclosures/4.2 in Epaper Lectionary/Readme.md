# Battery Sled
The present version of the case includes a sled to mount the battery holder and fix it securely within the case. The sled slides in at the bottom of the case, from the back, and is designed to accept a Keystone 1044 panel mounting 18650 battery holder with solder tabs (Mouser: https://www.mouser.co.uk/ProductDetail/Keystone-Electronics/1044?qs=up89fPMRNqDbJ6cCmjKOVA%3D%3D).
